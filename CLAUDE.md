# Working notes for this repo

## Until 17 Nov 2026: keep the one-site plan up to date

Owner decision, 6 Oct 2026: narenana is moving every indexable page onto www.narenana.com, one folder per product
(`/nanawing/`, `/nanawing2/`, `/log-viewer/`, `/wings/`). This repo becomes the one content home. The plan, with
milestones M1–M6, is [`docs/site-consolidation-plan.md`](docs/site-consolidation-plan.md).

If your change touches anything a visitor can read (maps, courses, aircraft, controls, log formats, feature or
privacy claims, prices or seller wording, the header or footer, a page title) or adds, removes or renames a page or
URL, update the plan as part of the same work:

1. Add a dated line to its **Change log**: what changed, repo and commit, milestone affected.
2. Page or URL added, removed or renamed: update its **URL map**. Fact changed: update its **Fact inventory** row,
   and fix the other copies listed there or add them to the M2 list.
3. If your change moves a milestone's date or scope, edit the milestone and say why.

A plan-only commit uses `[skip ci]`. This section is removed when the plan closes.
